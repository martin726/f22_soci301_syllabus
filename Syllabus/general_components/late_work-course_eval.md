## Late Work
Participation in discussions (Perusall or otherwise) must be on time so that others can respond to your posts. Thus, **discussion posts will not be accepted late for any reason (no matter how good you think your reason is).** Quizzes, practice activities, and essay assignments are a bit different. If you must submit one of these assignments late, please contact me right away. The longer you wait, the less likely I am to accept the assignment. I reserve the right to refuse any late work, but keeping the lines of communication open is your best bet if you fall a little behind on an assignment.
