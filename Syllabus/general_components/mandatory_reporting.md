## Mandatory Reporting
As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. I also have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as an instructor. It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am legally required to share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University. Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the [Counseling and Wellness Center](https://www.csuchico.edu/counseling/) (530-898-6345) or [Safe Place](https://www.csuchico.edu/safeplace/) (530-898-3030). Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related resources are available here: https://www.csuchico.edu/title-ix/
