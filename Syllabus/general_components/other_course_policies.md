#Other Course Policies

- Unless you have a documented emergency, there will be no substitutions for assignments, quizzes, or papers. A missed assignment, quiz, or paper will result in a zero. Incomplete grades (or an "I" grade) are rare, and will be given at the discretion of the professor. 

- “Pet Peeves”:

    1. Asking to be excused from rules that all classmates are following.
    2. Inappropriate or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.  If this behavior persists, the student will be reported to the Dean’s Office.
