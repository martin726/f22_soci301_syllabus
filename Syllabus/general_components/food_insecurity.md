## Food and Housing Insecurity

CSU Chico recognizes food and housing insecurity as a concern for many people.
Students who have difficulty securing adequate food or housing have long and short term
resources available at Chico State. Students are encouraged to contact the [Center for Healthy Communities](https://www.csuchico.edu/chc/) or 530-898-5323 for assistance in applying for CalFresh benefits for long term assistance with food access. For emergency food supplies, CalFresh application help, and emergency housing information, students are encouraged to visit the [Wildcat Food Pantry](https://www.csuchico.edu/basic-needs/pantry.shtml). The [Basic Needs Rapid Re-Housing Program](https://www.csuchico.edu/basic-needs/housing.shtml) assists eligible Chico State students experiencing **displacement, unsafe housing, potential homelessness (eviction) or homelessness** with housing.
