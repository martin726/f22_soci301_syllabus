## Late Work and Student Emergencies
Generally, late papers, past due participation in Perusall or extra-credit work will *not* be accepted in this course. However, there are some important exceptions to this rule. Whenever unexpected life challenges/emergencies or an illness interrupts your academic work, other measures will apply. If you are ill or face an emergency, you are asked to please notify the instructor immediately (via email or in person), and provide documentation of what has occurred to justify making-up your work or turning it in beyond it due date. Moreover, given the current COVID-19 pandemic, I am aware that your situation can change dramatically unexpectedly. **\textcolor{red}{If you are facing any personal, medical, financial or other challenges that impact your academic work, please inform me right away and we will work out a solution to your problem. I will do my best to accommodate your situation and allow you to complete your work at a later time if you missed a deadline.} \textcolor{red}{However, the longer you wait, the less likely I am to accept a late assignment. Furthermore, I reserve the right to refuse any late work thus, keeping the lines of communication open is your best bet if you fall a little behind on an assignment.}** 

The instructorâ€™s policy regarding late work is to give any student who is ill or has faced a
**documented medical/personal emergency** the opportunity to make up his/her academic work **within one week of the absence.** Therefore, it is imperative that you discuss with the instructor any emergencies and/or problems in order to assist you in completing your coursework. \textcolor{red}{\bf{Please also note that if you foresee being absent due to a conflict with religious observance(s), you must notify the instructor of your prospective absence during the first week of classes.}}

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to discuss these issues with the instructor in person or via Canvas.
