	abstract = {Theories of a “new imperialism” assume that world capitalism in the 21st century is still made up of “domestic capitals” and that distinct national economies and world political dynamics are driven by US efforts to offset the decline in hegemony amidst heightened inter-imperialist rivalry. These theories ignore empirical evidence on the transnationalization of capital and the increasingly salient role of transnational state apparatuses in imposing capitalist domination beyond the logic of the inter-state system. I argue here that US interventionism is not a departure from capitalist globalization but a response to its crisis. The class relations of global capitalism are now so deeply internalized within every nation-state that the classical image of imperialism as a relation of external domination is outdated. The end of the extensive enlargement of capitalism is the end of the imperialist era of world capitalism. The implacable logic of global accumulation is now largely internal to the complex of fractious political institutions through which ruling groups attempt to manage those relations. We need a theory of capitalist expansion – of the political processes and the institutions through which such expansion takes place, the class relations and spatial dynamics it involves.},

Directing material flows is a vital part of intercapitalist competition. Ecological imperialism creates asymmetries in the exploitation of the environment, unequal exchange, and a global metabolic rift. The 19th-century guano/nitrates trade illustrates the emergence of a global metabolic rift, as guano and nitrates were transferred from Peru and Chile to enrich the soils of Britain and other imperial countries. This global metabolic rift entailed the decline of soil fertility in Britain, importation of Chinese labor to Peru, mass export of natural fertilizer, degradation of the Peruvian/Chilean environment, war over possession of nitrates, and creation of debt-laden economies. It allowed Britain and other imperial countries to maintain an ‘environmental overdraft’ in their own countries, imperialistically drawing on the natural resources of the periphery. The social metabolic order of capitalism is inseparable from such ecological imperialism, which is as basic to the system as the search for profits itself.},

It argues that in this export industry, critical feminist thought on neo-liberal international trade and the feminization of labour is valid only for workers in the lowest ranks of the industry, the majority of whom are racialized women from low-income, peasant, indigenous, or mixed-race rural backgrounds who face precarious forms of labour. Meanwhile, an elite group of women from urban-middle and upper classes with Western education and European or mixed-race backgrounds work in management, participate in the growers’ associations and oversee the exploitative conditions and health risks that ﬂower production creates for their racialized lower class ‘sisters’. This case emphasizes the importance of considering the intersections of socio-economic status and race, together with gender and other structures, in order to determine who beneﬁts and loses from production for the global market. The article also introduces the concept of ‘racialization of labour’, arguing that the jobs created in the industry are not only feminized but racialized.},

The answer is that the analysis of that book is still valid, namely that the unpaid work of women in the household, the work of subsistence producers, working in the informal sector and the work of nature constitute the hidden underground of the capitalist world economy and its accumulation model. In this connection, I use the metaphor of an iceberg economy, where the largest part is hidden under the water. I called this devaluation of work then a process of housewifisation. Today, one speaks of precarisation of work. This work, however, is no longer restricted to women but includes men as well. It is the optimal work for capitalism. And most people in the world do this type of work. The problem is that our concept of labour which still refers only to wage labour, does not at all reflect this reality.},

	abstract = {In this article we review the theory of ecologically unequal exchange and its relevance for global environmental injustice. According to this theory, global political-economic factors, especially the structure of international trade, shape the unequal distribution of environmental harms and human development; wealthier and more powerful Global North nations have disproportionate access to both natural resources and sink capacity for waste in Global South nations. We discuss how the theory has roots in multiple perspectives on development, world-systems analysis, environmental sociology, and ecological economics. We detail research that tests hypotheses derived from ecological unequal exchange theory on several environmental harms, including deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and water pollution as well as related human well-being outcomes. We also discuss research on social forces that counter the harmful impacts of ecologically unequal exchange, including institutions, organizations, and environmental justice movements. We suggest that ecologically unequal exchange theory provides an important global political-economic approach for research in environmental sociology and other environmental social sciences as well as for sustainability studies more broadly.},

	abstract = {In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba faced the start of a crisis that decimated its economy. Helen Yaffe examines the astonishing developments that took place during and beyond this period. Drawing on archival research and interviews with Cuban leaders, thinkers, and activists, this book tells the remarkable story of how Cuba survived while the rest of the Soviet bloc crumbled. Drawing on contemporary events Yaffe shows how Cuba has been gradually introducing select market reforms. The government claims that these are necessary to sustain its socialist system, but many others believe they herald a return to capitalism. Examining key domestic initiatives including the creation of one of the world's leading biotechnological industries, its energy revolution, and medical internationalism alongside recent economic reforms, she shows why the revolution will continue post-Castro. This is a fresh, definitive account of Cuba's socialist revolution and the challenges it faces on its sixtieth anniversary},
