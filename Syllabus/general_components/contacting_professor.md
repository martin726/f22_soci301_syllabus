# Getting Help And Communicating With Your Professor

Remember, your professor is here to help you gain a rich understanding of the material. So, it is important to be connected to your instructor and seek help whenever you need it. However, it is primarily your responsibility to seek help when you need it. Use the following methods to get in touch and/or ask questions. 


## Communication policy
When contacting your about the course, please send message through "Message Your Professor" in BlackBoard. I check messages three times per day, Monday thru Friday, between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM. Please allow up to 24-48 hours for a response during the week. If you contact on the weekend, expect a reply the following Monday. 

- Requesting help: If you miss a class meeting, you should…

    1. First, look on the course website for material you missed. 
    2. Second, if you need help understanding the material, you should contact your classmate via Beach. Board (direct email or discussion board). 
    3. Third, if you still find it difficult, find some time to chat with me during office hours

- Requesting a 1-on-1, non-office-hour Zoom meeting:

    > If, after you’ve looked over the material yourself and reached out to classmates, you still need help but cannot attend office hours, you may email me to request a virtual Zoom meeting. For non-office-hour zoom meetings, I require at least a minimum of one-week's notice. 
  
- On-line communication

    > I require that all communication be done in a respectful, courteous, and professional manner. When in doubt, always err in these directions; for example, aim for being slightly more courteous than you may think you need to be. Nobody will object to an extra “please” or “thank you.” Always take a few minutes to read what you have written before posting a comment or sending an email – pause and think – could what you have written be construed as disrespectful, impolite, or snappy? When in doubt, re-think your words and tone, and re-calibrate your message. We may not always agree but disagreeing while simultaneously showing respect and courtesy toward someone is a skill that will serve you well throughout your life and in many contexts. Always make criticism constructive and not personal. If you disagree with someone, they should not feel personally attacked. Keep the ideas separate from the person. I will always keep these principles in mind when communicating with you – please do the same toward me and your fellow students. 

**I reserve the right to penalize individuals who do not demonstrate these basic principles in their communications.**
