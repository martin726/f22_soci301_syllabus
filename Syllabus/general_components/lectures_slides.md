# Other Course Policies

- Unless you have a documented emergency, there will be no substitutions for assignments, quizzes, or papers. A missed assignment, quiz, or paper will result in a zero. Incomplete grades (or an "I" grade) are rare, and will be given at the discretion of the professor. 

- “Pet Peeves”:

    1. Asking to be excused from rules that all classmates are following.
    2. **Inappropriate or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.  If this behavior persists, the student will be reported to the Dean’s Office.**
    
- As mentioned in the ["Three (3) Writing Assignments" section](#writing_assignments) above, all papers must be 12-point Times New Roman font (or 11-point Arial font), double-spaced, and have 1” margins. Students’ names are to be in the upper right hand corner with the date and student ID number included; also, include page numbers in the bottom right hand corner of the paper. Excessive spacing beyond this identification will result in the deduction of points.  Finally, follow APA citation style, and give full references. For help with formatting citations and bibliographies, visit the "Citing Sources" page in Meriam Library's website: https://libguides.csuchico.edu/cite

-	When there is evidence that a student has committed plagiary, copied the work of others, allowed others to copy their work, cheated on a quiz, altered class material or scores, or has inappropriate possession of quizzes, or sensitive material, the incident will be investigated by Student Judicial Affairs. **The consequences for academic dishonesty are severe, including receiving an “F” in the course. No exceptions.**

-	All written work will be assessed on content, depth, logic, and quality of written expression.

- Students are responsible for handling the necessary paperwork for adding or dropping this class. If a student does not withdraw, and does not attend class or complete required work, an “F” or “WU” will be reported for the final grade. Instructors may drop a student who does not attend the first two classes.
