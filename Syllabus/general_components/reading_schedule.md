## Tentative Reading Schedule

Readings we will cover are listed below. Note that I reserve the right to change the readings below based on new and developing information about what would best serve my students.  In the event that a reading has not been made available in a way that you can access it on Black Board or Perusall, please email me immediately so I may repost the reading/assignment in time for you to complete it before the next class period.
