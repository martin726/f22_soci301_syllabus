## Student Services 
Student services are designed to assist students in the development of their full academic potential and to motivate them to become self-directed learners. Students can find support for services such as skills assessment, individual or group tutorials, subject advising, learning assistance, summer academic preparation and basic skills development. Student services information can be found on the current students page of the [CSU Chico web site](https://www.csuchico.edu/sa/).

## Student Learning Center
The mission of the Student Learning Center (SLC) is to provide services that will assist CSU, Chico students to become independent learners. The SLC prepares and supports students in their college course work by offering a variety of programs and resources to meet student needs. The SLC facilitates the academic transition and retention of students from high schools and community colleges by providing study strategy information, content subject tutoring, and supplemental instruction. I suggest you visit the [Student Learning Center web site](https://www.csuchico.edu/slc/).

## Writing Center

Over the course of this semester, seek help at the Writing Center if you would like additional guidance and critique. You can access the Writing Center at [at their website](https://www.csuchico.edu/slc/writing-center/index.shtml). During graduate school, I found workshops and writing groups at the Writing Center on campus to be helpful in building my motivation and teaching me new strategies for writing efficiently. While it is not a requirement, I nevertheless urge you to meet with a writing tutor to review a writing assignment at least once during the semester.
