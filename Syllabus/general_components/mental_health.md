## Mental health

Being a university student is stressful and can negatively impact mental health. The [WellCat Counseling Center](https://www.csuchico.edu/counseling/) offers free counseling services to regularly enrolled students at California State University, Chico. There are a wide variety of reasons students seek counseling:

- Resolving personal problems or conflicts.
- Seeking clarification and support in making important life decisions.
- Experiencing an emotional crisis due to a traumatic incident or a series of incidents.
- Help in developing personal survival skills necessary to achieve personal goals.
