## Vaccinations

[Per the California State University Chancellor's Office policy, the Covid-19 vaccine and booster is required for students, faculty and staff, unless you obtain an exemption from the university](https://calstate.policystat.com/policy/11030468/latest/). \textcolor{red}{\bf{CSU Chico is requiring all students who are booster-eligible to certify having received their booster by August 15. Please note that dishonesty relating to the vaccination policy and/or your failure to comply with any other COVID-19 related safety policy or mandate, including the face covering requirement, may result in disciplinary action against you through the office of Student Conduct, Rights and Responsibilities, which can include suspension or expulsion from the California State University system.}}

## Masks

While masks are not required to attend in-person classrooms, they are *strongly recommended* at most indoor locations for the fall 2022 semester. Masking is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and others, especially indoors. Please continue to respect an individualâ€™s decision to wear a mask even if it is not required. The professor has chosen to wear a mask during lecture and will take the necessary steps to provide clearly audible lectures for both in-person and online students. 

### COVID policy re: attendance: 
Attendance in this class is mandatory; if you do not attend class, you will not pass. If, however, you are a campus student attending physical class and you are symptomatic, please contact me (via email), do not attend the in-person class, and contact the COVID hotline at **(530)-898-2222** for additional direction. Also, make sure you keep me updated as you learn more about your health status.
